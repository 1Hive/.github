We are a community of builders supporting Greenpill Chapters and regen communities with regenerative tools, guides and workshops focused on impact measurement, capital allocation and community coordination. Since October 2023, the Greenpill Dev Guild has been building a thriving community with weekly meetings, impactful workshops and collaborative projects that members actively contribute to. The Guild operates several grant rounds with Grant Ships and Gitcoin, funding regenerative projects across the gaming and public goods space. We welcome all to join us in advancing the regen movement and making meaningful impact!

## Projects

Discover our projects and why we build them.

### üåø [Green Goods](https://greengoods.app)

Green Goods is a project focused on bringing biodiversity onchain to better measure, track and reward impact on green spaces. We are building this to support Greenpill Brasil and create the foundation for a simple tool that captures environmental impact in a meaningful way.

### ü™∏ [Impact Reef](https://impactreef.app)

Impact Reef is designed to capture qualitative data for public good projects, backed by community endorsements. This initiative aims to surface the value and impact of these projects, making it easier for them to gain additional funding and support.

### üö¢ [Grant Ships](https://app.grantships.fun/ship/0x95582289B2cDc12925663bD9121307Dca6F21Cc3)

Grant Ships is a grant allocation game where the Greenpill Dev Guild competes with other allocators to fund games on Arbitrum. Using a retroactive and proactive funding mechanism, the Guild helps bring regenerative features into games, turning degens into regens and demonstrating the effectiveness of our unique funding model.

### üèπ [Allo Yeeter](https://github.com/greenpill-dev-guild/allo-yeeter)

Allo Yeeter is a simple strategy that allows funds to be sent to multiple addresses in just a few transactions. This project supports the growth of Gitcoin by offering an easy mechanism to allocate funds efficiently and quickly through Allo.
