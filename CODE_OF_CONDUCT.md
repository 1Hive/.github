## Introduction

The Greenpill Dev Guild is a network of developers and contributors focused on building regenerative digital infrastructure. We are committed to fostering a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment for all contributors. This Code of Conduct outlines the expectations for behavior within our community, both online and offline, including contributions to our GitHub repositories.

## Our Values

- **Ethical Development:** Prioritize ethical practices in development, ensuring that our projects contribute positively to society, the environment, and public goods.

3. **Be Transparent**: All decisions, whether technical or organizational, should be made transparently. Document your contributions clearly and openly.
4. **Commit to Collaboration**: Share your work early, provide feedback generously, and ask for help when needed. We grow stronger by learning from each other.
5. **Respect the Communityâ€™s Purpose**: The Greenpill Dev Guild is focused on building regenerative and ethical technology. Ensure that your contributions align with these goals.
6. **Be Responsible**: Hold yourself and others accountable. Own your mistakes, learn from them, and strive for continuous improvement.
