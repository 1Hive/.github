# Code of Conduct for Gardens

Gardens is built on the principles of community-driven governance and inclusive participation. We are committed to fostering a welcoming environment where all contributors can collaborate effectively, regardless of their background, experience level, or identity.

#### Our Community Covenant

Just as Gardens enables communities to create their own covenants for governance, our development community operates under shared values:

- **Respectful Communication**: We engage in constructive dialogue, listen actively, and assume good intentions from fellow contributors
- **Inclusive Collaboration**: We welcome diverse perspectives and encourage participation from contributors of all backgrounds and skill levels
- **Constructive Feedback**: We provide thoughtful, specific feedback aimed at improving the project and supporting fellow contributors
- **Shared Responsibility**: We take collective ownership of the project's success and help maintain a positive community environment

#### Expected Behavior

Contributors are expected to:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language in all communications
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences
- Give and receive constructive feedback gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the overall community and project
- Show empathy and kindness toward other community members
- Help newcomers feel welcome and supported

#### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary conduct of any kind
- Trolling, insulting comments, or personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Any conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting

#### Enforcement and Resolution

Community conflicts should first be addressed through direct, respectful communication. For serious issues or persistent problems:

1. Contact the maintainers through our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/tJWPg69ZWG)
2. Report issues privately via GitHub or Discord direct messages
3. For urgent matters, reach out to project maintainers directly

We believe in restorative rather than punitive approaches, focusing on education and community healing when possible.

#### Building Together

Gardens v2 empowers communities to govern themselves through transparent, participatory processes. Our development community embraces these same principles, encouraging open discussion, collaborative decision-making, and shared stewardship of this public good.
