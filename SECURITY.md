## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you identify a potential security vulnerability in any of our repositories, please follow these steps:

1. **Contact**: Email the issue details to our security team at [security@greenpill.builders].
   - Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, the affected component(s), and the potential impact.
   - Provide steps to reproduce the issue if possible.

2. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days and begin assessing the report.

3. **Investigation and Remediation**: We aim to address valid security issues promptly and will keep you updated on our investigation status.
   - Critical issues will receive immediate attention, while minor vulnerabilities will be addressed in due course.

4. **Responsible Disclosure**: We request that you give us a reasonable time to address the issue before disclosing it publicly.

## Security Measures and Best Practices

We implement the following security practices:

- **Access Control**: We enforce strict access control measures to ensure only authorized contributors can modify critical repositories.
- **Dependencies Management**: We regularly update dependencies and run automated vulnerability scans on dependencies.
- **Code Review**: Code changes undergo peer review to identify potential vulnerabilities before merging into main branches.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: We utilize GitHub security tools (e.g., Dependabot, Code Scanning) to monitor for potential vulnerabilities.
